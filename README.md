# Algoex

Elixir API wrapper for the Algorand PureStake APIs (Indexer and Algod).

*This is very very new and a WIP - something like v0.0.1*

**Note: Currently only supports the Indexer API.**

TODO:
- Add in relevant spec / typespec / types
- Add in relevant docs
- Reference [library guidelines](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/master/library-guidelines.html) and make sure everything is good.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `algoex_index` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:algoex_index, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/algoex_index>.
